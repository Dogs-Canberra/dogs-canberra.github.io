## Our Policy
We take your privacy seriously.
We will only use the data we collect from you to contact you directly with regards to Dogs Canberra or to provide you with a service or experience you have explicitly requrested from Dogs Canberra.
We will not sell your data.
We will not make your data available to third parties without your explicit consent unless we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
* Fulfill any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.
* Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security issues.
* Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Canberra Dogs, our members, or the public as required or permitted by law.

We will not publish your personal data or use any of your data, including any photos that may be taken of you at Dogs Canberra events for publicity or marketing purposes without your explicit consent.

Your data will be encrypted and securely stored. Access to your data will be restricted to members of Dogs Canberra with a legitimate need to see it to perform their duties.

You may request a copy of any data we hold about you at any time. You have the right to request the correction or deletion of your data at any time, and we will act on any such request as soon as we are able.
